# Creating RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) application in PHP

This application uses LLM (Large Language Model) GPT-4o accessed via OpenAI API in order to generate text based on the user input. 
The user input is used to retrieve relevant information from the database and then the retrieved information is used to generate the text.
This approach combines power of transformers and access to source documents.

## Setup:
1. Run in CLI: `cd app/src && composer install`
2. Create api_key.txt file inside app/src and put there your OpenAI API key
3. Run docker-compose: `docker-compose up`
4. Open address 127.0.0.1 in browser and ask your question

## Usage:

1. Run docker interactive `docker exec -it php-app sh`

2. Run in CLI: `php minicli rag`

3. Ask question

### Example output:
#### Example 1
```
##### INPUT:
What is the result of 2 + 2?
##### RESPONSE:
The result of 2 + 2 is 4.
```

#### Example 2
```
##### INPUT:

#### Example 3
```
##### INPUT: 
Is Michał Żarnecki programmer the same person as Michał Żarnecki audio engineer?

##### RESPONSE:
Based on the information provided, it appears that Michał Żarnecki the programmer and Michał Żarnecki the audio engineer are not the same person.
Here’s why:
1. **Fields of Expertise**:
 - Michał Żarnecki, the audio engineer, was a well-known operator and reżyser dźwięku (sound director) in Poland, with notable contributions to the Polish film industry, as mentioned in the Wikipedia excerpt.
 - Michal Żarnecki, the programmer, has a portfolio focused on programming in Python, PHP, and JavaScript, with projects related to AI, machine learning, data mining, and software development.
2. **Lifespan**:
 - Michał Żarnecki the audio engineer was born on November 12, 1946, and passed away on November 21, 2016.
 - The projects listed in Michał Żarnecki the programmer’s portfolio date from 2014 to 2016, which would be conflicting if he had passed away in 2016 and was actively working in those years. 
3. **Occupational Focus**:
 - The audio engineer has a career documented in film sound engineering and education.
 - The programmer’s career is centered around software development, mobile applications, ERP systems, and consulting in technology.

Given the distinct differences in their professional domains, timelines, and expertise, it is highly unlikely that they are the same individual
